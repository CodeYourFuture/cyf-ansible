# cyf-ansible

Ansible playbook to provision Code Your Future laptops, based on Linux Ubuntu.

- ZSH and Oh my ZSH
- Slack
- Visual Studio Code (with prettier, python and babel extensions)

## Prerequisities

- Ansible (install it with `sudo apt-get install ansible` on Linux Ubuntu)

## Usage

### Run from a unique Ansible machine

- Edit the file `inventory` which describes the machines which you want to run this playbook onto.
- These machines need be reachable over SSH. You need to have one line per machine in the `inventory` file with the machine IP, the username and SSH password to connect. These machines need to be reachable from the computer which will execute the Ansible playbook (same network).
(Locate machines by IP address on the local network using `nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24` (or equivalent).
- Run `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml` which will run the Ansible playbook on each machine described in the `inventory` file.

### Run Ansible on each machine

- If for some reason machines cannot be reached by SSH, we can still run the Ansible playbook on each individual machine.
- `git clone` this repo on each machine
- Edit the file `inventory` and just mention `localhost ansible_connection=local`
- Run `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml` on each machine.

## Testing

You can test this playbook on a VM. You will need Vagrant and VirtualBox installed.
Then run `vagrant up` to bring up the VM and `vagrant up --provision` to rerun Ansible.
